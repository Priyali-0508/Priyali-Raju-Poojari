**üß† Introduction**

An AI-powered email phishing detector developed using Python and machine learning as part of the Digisuraksha Internship Program 2025. This tool analyzes the textual content of emails to classify them as phishing or legitimate, using a Random Forest classifier with TF-IDF vectorization. It features both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for fast testing and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for ease of use. Lightweight, fast, and effective, this project serves as an educational or prototype-level solution for detecting phishing threats.

**üö® Problem Statement**

Phishing emails are crafted to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, bank details, or login credentials. As attackers grow more sophisticated, traditional email filters often fail to detect these threats.
This project aims to build an AI-based email phishing detector that classifies emails as phishing or legitimate based on their content using machine learning. The tool enhances digital safety by providing instant feedback on email authenticity.

**üß∞ Features**
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares email content for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF to extract meaningful features.
- **Model Training**: Implements ML algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
- **Prediction**: Classifies emails as 'Phishing' or 'Legitimate'.
- **Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
