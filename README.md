# 👩‍💻 Priyali Poojari – Cybersecurity Internship 2025

## 👋 About Me

I am Priyali Poojari, a final-year Bsc Information Technology student with a deep interest in cybersecurity, machine learning, and digital threat detection. I am passionate about applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world security challenges in a meaningful and ethical way.

During the Cybersecurity Internship 2025, organized by the Digisuraksha Parhari Foundation, I had the opportunity to explore how AI can be used to combat phishing — one of the most prevalent and dangerous forms of cyberattacks. I chose this project because phishing continues to be a major threat across industries, and I wanted to build a practical, AI-based solution to address it.

## 📌 Project Title
**AI-Powered Phishing Email Detector**

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Phishing attacks are increasingly sophisticated, posing major risks to both individuals and organizations. Traditional spam filters often fall short due to evolving phishing techniques. My goal was to create a machine learning-based tool that can accurately classify emails as phishing or legitimate using natural language processing.

---

## 🛠️ My Contribution

- Designed and trained a machine learning model (Random Forest + TF-IDF) for phishing email detection.
- Developed a command-line interface (CLI) tool and a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter.
- Authored a comprehensive research paper documenting the methodology, results, and future scope.
- Created a presentation slide deck and a market analysis document.
- Recorded a demo video showcasing how the tool works.
- Structured and documented the entire project per internship submission guidelines.
